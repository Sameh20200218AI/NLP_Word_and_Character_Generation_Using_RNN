following examplesto apply the affine matrix to an image the image is converted to matrix in which each entry corresponds to the pixel intensity at that location then each pixels location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image x y where x and y are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix then each pixels location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image x y where x and y are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix this allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affinetransformation matrix which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output imagehowever to allow transformations that require translation transformations 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed this allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affinetransformation matrix which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output imagehowever to allow transformations that require translation transformations 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed the third dimension is usually set to a nonzero constant usually 1 so that the new coordinate is x y 1 the third dimension is usually set to a nonzero constant usually 1 so that the new coordinate is x y 1 this allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a 3 by 3 matrix enabling translation shifts this allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a 3 by 3 matrix enabling translation shifts so the third dimension which is the constant 1 allows translationbecause matrix multiplication is associative multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done so the third dimension which is the constant 1 allows translationbecause matrix multiplication is associative multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done this results in a single matrix that when applied to a point vector gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector x y 1 in sequence this results in a single matrix that when applied to a point vector gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector x y 1 in sequence thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrixfor example 2 dimensional coordinates only allow rotation about the origin 0 0 thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrixfor example 2 dimensional coordinates only allow rotation about the origin 0 0 but 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to 0 0 then perform the rotation and lastly translate the origin 0 0 back to the original point the opposite of the first translation but 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to 0 0 then perform the rotation and lastly translate the origin 0 0 back to the original point the opposite of the first translation these 3 affine transformations can be combined into a single matrix thus allowing
